#### Hi, there!
I am a technology lover, fascinated by innovation and software development. More specifically, I am interested in web development, devops, software infrastructure, software architecture, code design, software security, agile and digital product management.

Right now, I am working as Software Developer at @loomi. I am focused on front-end development - using React, mainly -, but I also work as a back-end developer on some projects - using Node.js, Django and PostgreSql, for example.
