#### Hi, there!
I am a technology lover, fascinated by innovation and software development. More specifically, I am interested in web development, devops, software infrastructure, software architecture, code design, software security, agile and digital product management.

Right now, I am working as Software Manager in a project for CITi, but I also work as a developer on personal projects, using,  for example, Node.js, React, Vue.js and FastAPI.
